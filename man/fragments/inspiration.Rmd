[rsam]: https://github.com/yonicd/rsam

shrtcts was inspired by [rsam],
the _RStudio Addins Manager_ by [&commat;yonicd](https://github.com/yonicd).
There's a lot that rsam can do ---
including helping you manage your keyboard shortcuts ---
and shrtcts is essentially an extension of rsam's
[limited liability addins](https://github.com/yonicd/rsam#limited-liability-addins).
rsam provides three slots for custom addins
that in turn look for specially-named functions defined in the global environment.
In the addins menu,
these three custom addins appear as
**lla1**, **lla2**, and **lla3**.
The upside of rsam
is that you don't have to write code in YAML (huge plus!),
but the downside is that the names of the addins are fixed.

shrtcts,
on the other hand,
rewrites its own addin registry so that you can have customized addin names and descriptions.
In both packages,
the number of custom addins is limited:
rsam provides 3 slots,
while shrtcts gives you 100.
