### RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts

Once you've setup an RStudio Addin via
`shrtcts`, you can create a keyboard shortcut for the addin using the
_Tools_ > _Modify keyboard shortcuts_ menu.

If you create a shortcut for an addin via `shrtcts`, it's a good idea to
set the `id` of the shortcut (see the section above).

Keyboard shortcuts persist even if you update the list of shortcuts, but
re-installing the `shrtcts` package will break any previously-installed
shortcuts. As far as I know, there's no way to save and restore these
shortcuts, so use caution.
